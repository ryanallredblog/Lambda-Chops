# Start Writing Python with Google Colaboratory

You can get started writing Python right this minute without installing any tools or doing any setup. All that you need is a Google Account. Just go to [colab.research.google.com](http://colab.research.google.com) and login with your Google Account.

## What is Google Colaboratory?

Google Colaboratory is a Google Drive based platform for authoring and running Jupyter Notebooks. Jupyter Notebooks (or more specifically IPython notebooks) are a file where you can write and execute snippets of Python code and see the result of each code snippet outputted just below the code that you have written. 

Google Colab (for short) runs in the cloud and acts like any Google Drive document. It's free, shareable, and colaborative -hence the name. It's a Google Doc but for writing and executing Python code.

## Google Colab is just a fancy REPL

REPL stands for Read, Evaluate, Print, Loop. If you have ever interacted with the Python Interpreter via the command-line before, you have also used a Python REPL.

But even if you haven't, don't worry about it. A REPL is just a cycle of prompting the user to write some Python code, running/evaluating that Python code, printing out the result, and then looping back to the beginning to prompt the user all over again. That's what Google Colab is, it's a REPL that's made to look nice and be user friendly in the browser. 

Go ahead and try and run some Python Code in a Google Colab notebook. You can run a cell by pressing the play/run button in the top left corner of the cell or you can use the keyboard shortcut `shift` + `enter`. If you've never written any python code before, just try typing some math into one of the cells and see how it is evaluated. 

You might also try entering in the traditional first line of code in many languages, try typing:

```python
print("Hello World!")
```

and see if you can get `Hello World!` to output below the cell.
